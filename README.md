# Equation Solver

## Overview
This project is an advanced equation solver implemented in Python, supporting both linear and quadratic equations. It leverages object-oriented programming principles, including abstract base classes, subclass initialization, and regular expressions for equation formatting.

## Features
- **Supports Linear & Quadratic Equations**: Implements `LinearEquation` and `QuadraticEquation` classes.
- **Abstract Base Class**: Uses an `Equation` class as a blueprint with abstract methods.
- **Automatic Subclass Validation**: Implements `__init_subclass__` to enforce required attributes.
- **Equation String Formatting**: Uses the `re` module for clean equation representation.
- **Solving & Analysis**: Computes equation solutions and provides additional insights such as slopes, intercepts, and concavity.

## Implementation Details
### `Equation` Class (Base Class)
- Implements an abstract base class (`ABC`) to enforce method definitions in subclasses.
- Stores equation coefficients in a dictionary where keys represent the power of `x`.
- Includes `__str__` for formatted equation output using `re.sub` to remove unnecessary coefficients.

### `__init_subclass__` Method
- Ensures that every subclass has `degree` and `type` attributes.
- Raises an error if these attributes are missing, preventing improper subclass definitions.
- This helps maintain consistency and avoid runtime errors.

### Regular Expressions (`re` Module)
- Used in the `__str__` method to remove unnecessary `1` coefficients (e.g., `1x` â†’ `x`).
- Ensures a cleaner and more readable equation representation.

## Usage
### Solving a Linear Equation:
```python
lin_eq = LinearEquation(2, 3)
print(solver(lin_eq))
```
**Output:**
```
-----Linear Equation------

       2x +3 = 0        

--------Solutions--------

        x = -1.500      

---------Details---------

     slope =     2.000  
 y-intercept =     3.000
```

### Solving a Quadratic Equation:
```python
quadr_eq = QuadraticEquation(1, 2, 1)
print(solver(quadr_eq))
```
**Output:**
```
---Quadratic Equation---

      x**2 +2x +1 = 0    

-------Solutions-------

        x = -1.000      

--------Details--------

  concavity = upwards   
      min = (-1.000, 0.000)
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Uses built-in modules (`abc`, `re`).
